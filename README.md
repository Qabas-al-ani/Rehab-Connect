This is achieved through posting to certain milestones on the site and viewing others stories as they have reached that milestone aswell.

## Development

A project manager tool was used in order to keep track of what everyone on the team was working on and to track the progress of the site itself. The github project manager was used through creating issues and assigning them to specific team members.

## Usage

In order to begin adding your story to a milestone you must first create an account, this is done through the sign up page and after you create your account you are automatically logged in. Once you click on any specific milestone you can then add your story and through the form at the bottom of the page. Be sure to stay honest and remember that others on the site are going through the same hardships as you.

## Challenges

The main challenge found with creating this site was creating templates for pages and creating associated routes to render those pages, all the while rendering the correct information and making sure a good ui stayed intact.
Another issue run into was creating handler functions to deal with a log-in post and a sign-up post and redirecting the client once a user is logged in.
